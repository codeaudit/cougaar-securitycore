#
# This file contains the protocols that we expect to see while running
# the Cougaar society. Each line contains:
#  - A protocol identifier as defined by tethereal
#  - A flag that indicates whether this protocol is encrypted or not.
#       unencrypted:	The data is not encrypted.
#       encrypted:	The data is encrypted.
#  - A flag that specifies whether the level of protection is appropriate or not.
#       ok:             Either the data is encrypted, or it is ok when the data is not encrypted.
#                       See below why some protocols may be unencrypted.
#       bad:            The data should be encrypted but it is not.
#  - The user-friendly name of the protocol (optional)
# 
# Ethernet frames exist in a LAN environment only. Routers remove Ethernet frames before they
# are sent to WAN networks. The frames are not encrypted, even if a protocol such as IPSEC is used. 
#
# Ethernet, IP, TCP and UDP headers contain unencrypted data.
# Some of these headers could be protected by using IPSEC.
#
# frame.eth.ip.tcp.data: this is usually a TCP packet with the PSH flag on.
# PSH = This flag calls a PUSH. If this flag is on, then the 
#       TCP-module has to send the data from the segment directly 
#       to the target application. Normally, the TCP-Module would 
#       keep the incoming data in a buffer and sends them untill 
#       the target application's buffer is full. The PSH-flag lets 
#       the TCP-Module know that the data of this segment does not
#       have to arrive in the buffer. Telnet-Applications for example 
#       uses this flag. Because of that, TCP sends the inputted keys
#       of the user directly to the Telnet-server. This lets the user
#       see the typed-letters immediately, without lag.
