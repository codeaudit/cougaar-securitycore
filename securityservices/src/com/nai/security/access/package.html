Defines objects used for access control on top of the COUGAAR architecture. 
Classes in this package provide implementations of access control enforcement.

The <CODE>AgentTrustService</CODE> is a non-privileged interface to the
<CODE>TrustAttributeService</CODE>, which is a node-level service that 
maintains buckets of objects, which map to a collection of one or more  
<CODE>TrustAttribute</CODE>(s). The <CODE>TrustSet</CODE> contains a set of 
trust attributes which can be enumrated through or accessed directly by type.
