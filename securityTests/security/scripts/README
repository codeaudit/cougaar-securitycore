The files in this directory are included from the experiment scripts:

* setup_scripting.rb: should be the first script to be included before any
   other security include script.
   Has a list of "require" that load required libraries.

* setup_society_ping.rb: actions specific to the PING society

* setup_society_1000_ua.rb: actions specific to the 1000 UA society

* Basic security tests that verify the security services are working properly.
    For example:
      - check_wp.rb
      - check_certs.rb
    All security tests are included in the check_all_basic_tests.rb, so the 
    experiment file does not have to list all the basic tests.

* Stresses are grouped per security use case.
    - stress_security_uc1.rb
    - stress_security_uc2.rb
    ...

   Every UC script may include other scripts that perform specific actions, such
   as doing a bad login failure, using a bad certificate, etc.
