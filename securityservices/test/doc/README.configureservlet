How to Configure Servlet

Per requisite before configuring Servlet :
1 Install tomcat. It can be found at www.apache.org. Test that apaches servlet engine is working fine by typing http://host:port no/, where host is machine on which tomcat is installed and port number is port on which tomcat http is running. For how to configure Tomcat refer to installation gide provide with tomcat.
2 Install security services module.

Procedure to configure  servlet for Security services 
1. Create a CA directory under Tomcat_Home/webapps
2. Create WEB-INF directory under CA.
3. copy web.xml provided with securityservices installation from test/configs/servlet/  into WEB-INF dir.
4. Create a classes and lib directory under WEB-INF.
5. Copy core.jar provided by cougaar installation and securityservices.jar form securityservices  into lib directory and other directory, refer to compiling and installation doc for securityservices module.
6. Create a directory structure as shown below
com
	nai	
		security	
			certauthority
copy CertificateSigningRequest.class, CertificateDetailsServlet.class, CertificateList.class, RevokeCertificateServlet.class in to certauthority  dir.
The classes directory only contains the servlet class and all the other helper classes required by the servlet should be put in lib directory. Servlet classes are using classes from securityservices.jar and core.jar.

Servlet name to class mapping is specified in web.xml security services module. For installation of security service module refer to README.install.
sample of web.xml  is as shown below :

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE web-app
    PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN"
    "http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd">
<web-app>
    <!-- Define servlets that are included in the example application -->
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>certrequest</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>com.nai.security.certauthority.CertificateSigningRequest</servlet-class>
    </servlet>
    <servlet>
        <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>
	certrequest
        </servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>
            /CertSign
        </url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
</servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
				

The URL used to connect to servlet is as follows:
http://host:portno/CA/servlet/servletname
where host is the name of host running the tomcat server, portno is the  port at which it is running, servlet name is name of the servlet you want to invoke .
All certificate related service are put under CA URL.
