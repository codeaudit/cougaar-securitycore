Type 'make' on the command line.


Running the attack
==================

1) Start the echo server on one machine
./echo_server

2) Generate the attack code
./exploit4 768

  This will give a shell prompt.

3) From the previous shell prompt, type:
./attack_script.sh <hostname>

where hostname is the host where the echo server is running
