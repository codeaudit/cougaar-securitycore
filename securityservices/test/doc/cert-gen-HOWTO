1. Edit an xml file for configuring the key generation process for a society, 
   starting with a society tag, in this example, the ul-mini-config society is
   used.

<society title="UL-MINI-CONFIG">
.
.
.
1a. For each node create a keystare file, supplying the file name and password

<keystorefile>
       <storepass>the-actual-password-NCADomainManager</storepass>
       <keystore>keystore-NCADomainManager</keystore>

.
.
.
1b. For each CA and certificate add a block similar to the following:

 <trustedCA>
          <alias>ROOT-CA-CONUS</alias>
          <file>ROOT-CA-CONUS.cer</file>
       </trustedCA>
.
.
.
1c. The folowing block generates a key for the NCADomainManager agent.
 Cryptographic services requires that each node and agent within that node have
 a signed certificate and key pair. Add a similar element block for each
<key>
          <alias>NCADomainManager</alias>
          <keypass>ul-NCADomainManager</keypass>
          <keyalg>RSA</keyalg>
          <sigalg>MD5withRSA</sigalg>
          <keysize>2048</keysize>
          <signingAuthority>ROOT-CA-CONUS</signingAuthority>
          <dname>CN=NCADomainManager, O=CONUS, OU=NCA, L=Washington DC, S=DC, C=US</dname>
       </key>
.
.
.

1d. End the keystore block for the node. Each node requiring cyrptographic services should have a <keystorefile> element in the XML file.
    </keystorefile>
.
.
.
1f. End the society tag:
<society>


2. Generate key pairs and certificate signing requests. The private key for 
   each node is securely stored in the corresponding key store. Certificate 
   requests are stored in individual files--since these are public keys, they
   do not need to be immediately in the key store.

./run-genkey ul-mini-config-cert.xml -genkey 

3. Submit certificate request to the certificate authority (CA) for signing. CA
   certificates at the root level are self-signed. Non-root CA's should have a
   certificate chain of 1 or more certificates which should lead to a self-
   signed certificate. 

4. Import the signed certificates into the keystores. 

./run-genkey ul-mini-config-cert.xml -importsigned

5. Import all public keys into each keystore.

./run-genkey ul-mini-config-cert.xml -importpub

6. The keystores have now been fully populated and need to be installed into 
   the directory containing the society's configuration files. For example, the
   ul-mini-config keystores need to be placed in the 
   configs/common/ul-mini-config directory.
