<H1>Understanding Policy Builder Exceptions</H1>


The most common type of problem that occurs when building policies for
the policy builder is an exception that indicates that KAoS does not
have sufficient information to validate the policy being submitted.  A
typical exception of this type has the following form:
<pre>
  05:42:31,880 ERROR - KBSPolicyHandlerPlugin - KBSPolicyAgent: Exception
  found updating policy
  com.cougaarsoftware.core.knowledgeservice.KnowledgeBaseException: 
                                                    Error building policies
        at ...
           ...
  Caused by: org.cougaar.core.security.policy.builder.PolicyCompilerException:

        at org....policy.builder.ParsedPolicy.checkActorIsInstance...
            ...
  Caused by: org.cougaar.core.security.policy.builder.PolicyCompilerException:
  urn:KBUserByRole#503 is not a member of 
  http://ontology.ihmc.us/Actor.owl#Actor
        at  ...OntologyConnection.verifyInstanceOf(OntologyConnection.java:136)
        at  ...
        ... 8 more
</pre>
In this error message the root cause of the problem is actually the
second "Caused by " above and not the third.  What has happened was
that the policy builder tried to check that urn:KBUserByRole#503 was
either a subclass or instance of the kaos actor class.  The policy
builder first tried the subclass and failed.  This is the check that
should have succeeded.  Then the policy builder tried to see if
urn:KBUserByRole#503 was an instance of an actor and this is the
exception that propagated for the third "Caused by".
<p>
There is actually enough information above that an expert in OWL
(more expert than me) might detect the problem.  When I saw this I was
puzzled because I knew that I had created an ontology that indicated
that "urn:KBUserByRole#503" was a subclass of Actor.owl#Person.  In
fact (since the code is short) here is how the ontology was created
(from Actor.java):
<pre>
    SerializableOntModelImpl model = new SerializableOntModelImpl();
    OntClass personClass  = model.createClass(ActorConcepts.Person);
    OntClass myActorClass = model.createClass(getOwlName());
    personClass.addSubClass(myActorClass);
    model.write(new PrintWriter(new DebugWriter()), "RDF/XML-ABBREV");
</pre>
I looked in the logs and sure enough I saw the ontology:
<pre>
 &lt;rdf:RDF
     xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
     xmlns:owl="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#"
     xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"&gt
   &lt;owl:Class rdf:about="urn:KBUserByRole#503"&gt
     &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://ontology.ihmc.us/Actor.owl#Person"
        rdf:type="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Class"/&gt
   &lt;/owl:Class&gt
 &lt;/rdf:RDF&gt
</pre>
It was clear from the actor ontology that Actor.owl#Person is a
subclass of Actor.owl#Actor and so it was still not clear to me what
the problem was.  However on the standard out there was an error
message that occured when this ontology was being sent to KAoS:
<pre>
    2005-05-28 05:42:31,870 SHOUT [DOTS] - +
     line 1:75: expecting SYMBOL, found '503'
     line 1:75: expecting SYMBOL, found '503'
</pre>
These errors occured while the ontology was being parsed so it was not
getting to the KAoS inference engine.  This made it clear that the
problem was that 
<pre>
        "urn:KBUserByRole#503"
</pre>
was not a valid OWL symbol.  We fixed the error by changing the way we
represent the set of users in the role '503'.  We now represent this
with the OWL classname
<pre>
        "urn:KBUserByRole#Role503"
</pre>
Other more typical reasons for getting errors like
<pre>
      ... is not a subclass or instance of the kaos actor class
</pre>
include forgetting to tell KAoS everything that it needs to know and
typos.
