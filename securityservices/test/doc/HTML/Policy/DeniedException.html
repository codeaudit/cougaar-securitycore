<H1>Reading Permission Denied Logs</H1>

When the policy denies access to a resource, a permission denied
warning is placed in the logs.  These messages are currently somewhat
arcane and difficult to read.  However, they are very useful for
understanding policy errors.  Here is an example where a user in the
FwdUserDomainComm attempts to access the rear enclave policy domain manager.
The error in the logs is as follows:
<pre>
21:33:59,375 WARN  - ServletNodeEnforcer - Permission denied

</pre>
There are three log messages above.  The first message indicates that
the access is denied, the second describes the action being denied
and the third provides additional supplemental information (which is
often specific to the action type).
<p>
The most important two things to discover about the action being
denied is the actor performing the action and the type of action
being performed.  The action being performed is identified by
the "actor:" line in the action description.  We see that  this
action is performed by the actor User614.  There is another "actor:"
line a couple of lines below the first one.  The second version has
an expanded description of the actor as a KAoSProperty.  The
KAoSProperty  indicates that the actor is given by who the action is
"performedBy".  Again the actor is given as User614.
<p>
By looking at the "action:" line we see that the action is a
ServletAccess action.  Continuing down the logs  we see that
<ul>
<li> the "usedAuditLevel" is "Audit".
<li> the "usedAuthenticationLevel" is "Password"
<li> the "accessedServlet is RearPolicyServlet.
</ul>
<p>
User614 is an internal Ultra*Log name for the user who attempted to
login.  KAoS never sees the real loging name for the user, it only
sees a name like User614.  Therefore wwe have to go to the suplemental
information in the third log statement which describes the
relationship between the KAoS name for the user and definition of the
user to the  cougaar system.  This statement indicates that user
User614 is in the 
roles SocietyAdmin, UserManager, MonitorManager, Logistician,
PolicyAdministrator, LogisticsViewer, and CAAdministrator.  
<p>
This ends the examination of the log file entries.  
<p>
We then examine the policies in force.  The policies in force can come
from several different places.  In a vanilla security servies
implementation (e.g. Ultra*Log), the boot policies come from a
configuration file (OwlBootPolicyList) which is usually hidden in the
jar file ${CIP}/configs/security/bootpolicies.jar.  If the policies
have been created by a policy management tool like KPAT or the CSI
Core Commanders Portal then we can get the policies from there.
Finally, if there is no other easy source for the policies we can
query the policyViewer servlet off the node.
<p>
When we look at the boot policies we discover the problem.  The
boot polices require that anyone accessing the
RearPolicyServlet be in the role "xRearPolicyAdministrator" (the name
xRearPolicyAdministrator is generated automatically by the rule
policy_boot_policy_list.rule.)   The relevant policy is
<pre>
  Policy PolicyServletRear = [
    ServletUserAccessTemplate
    A user in role "xRearPolicyAdministrator" can access a servlet 
    named "RearPolicyServlet"
  ]
</pre>
Without this role access is denied.  User614 is not in this role; the
closest match is PolicyAdministrator.
