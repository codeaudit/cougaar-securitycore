This document describes how to register scripts with Polaris
and how to execute those scripts.

I) Installing Cougaar
=====================
* Install Cougaar by invoking update_cougaar and selecting the appropriate
  overlays. In addition to the standard set of overlays, you will need to 
  install the security services and the SRI automation overlay.
* On sb022, check out or updated the automation and moptools modules in the following
  directories:
    ~/CSI/polaris/automation  (:ext:srosset@cvs.ultralog.net:/cvs/commons/sri)
    ~/CSI/polaris/moptools    (:ext:srosset@cvs.ultralog.net:/cvs/security/csi)

II) Registering scripts with Polaris
====================================
1) Edit the $CIP/csmart/acme_scripting/bin/p-config.rb file
   See Section V) below
   This is done automatically in the registerScripts.sh script
2) Invoke the registerScripts.sh script:
   sh registerScripts.sh

TODO: it would be nice to be able to register all scripts automatically
(e.g. no need to manually register every script)

III) Executing scripts with Polaris
==================================
Normally, scripts would be executed unattended as described in section III).
However, it might be useful to run the scripts from the command line
for debugging purposes. This section describe how to run the scripts from
the command line.

1) Edit the $CIP/csmart/acme_scripting/bin/p-config.rb file
   See Section V) below
   This is done automatically in the runPolaris.sh script
2) Invoke the runPolaris.sh script

TODO: it would be nice to run the scripts one after the other

IV) Running nightly tests
==========================
This section describes how to run the scripts unattended (e.g. nightly scripts)

* Type the following command as root:
   crontab -u asmt crontab.conf

  This will run all the scripts automatically

V) Editing the p-config.rb file
=================================
Set the POLARIS_HOST environment variable to "polaris.ultralog.net" as shown below:

# $POLARIS - Is Polaris running?  Should always be true.
$POLARIS=true

# $POLARIS_HOST - Which Polaris Host are you running against?
# It should be polaris.ultralog.net for production stuff, u180 for testing.
$POLARIS_HOST="polaris.ultralog.net"

# $POLARIS_UPDATE - Should we download Cougaar and its Overlays, or reuse
# the installation already on the the disk.
$POLARIS_UPDATE=false

# $POLARIS_CVS_HOME - This is the place where p-runner.rb will check out
# the scripts it needs to run.
$POLARIS_CVS_HOME="/polaris"

# $POLARIS_REGIME - Set this value to the type of tests being run.  For
# example:
#    DEV - Developing scripts, not for reporting.
#    ETA - Engineering Tests
#    ASMT - Assessment
#    ART - Art & Mark (ISAT)
$POLARIS_REGIME="DEV"
