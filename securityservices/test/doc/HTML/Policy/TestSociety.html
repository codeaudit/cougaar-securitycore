In this document, we will describe a society that has been explicitly
designed for testing policy requirements.  The society is located in
<pre>
    securityservices/test/configs/policies/society/Policy.rb 
</pre>
and is configured in the same way as other csmart societies.  It has
the following features:
<ul>
<li> It can be run on a single node.
<li> It has special features for testing message passing policies,
     blackboard policies and servlet policies.
<li> There are a collection of command line tool policies that can
     used to test various policy features.
</ul>
We will illustrate these features by describing all the test policies
associated with this society and what they do.
<p>
Before doing any testing of the command line policies, one must
first run the policy script (Policy.rb) and wait for it to complete.
This script 
<ol>
<li> starts the society, 
<li> waits for critical Ultra*Log security components to come up
  (particularly the user manager which is  waiting for the community
  service to provide community information)
<li> commits an initial set of policies to the domain manager.
</ol>
Once the script is completed we are ready to continue with the policy
tests.

<H1>Blackboard Access Tests</H1>

We have configured the test society to make some blackboard access
tests very easy.  In RearWorkerNode there is an agent called
testBBPolicyAgent.  This agent has a servlet that adds OrgActivity
objects to the blackboard.  The boot policies and configutation files give
this agent the ability to add OrgActivity objects to the blackboard.
In particular the file OwlMapRoleUri has the line
<pre>
/$testBBPolicyAgent/OrgActivityAdd http://ontology.ihmc.us/Ultralog/PluginsInRole#OrgActivityAdd
</pre>

<pre>
   org.cougaar.glm.ldm.oplan.OrgActivity http://ontology.ihmc.us/Ultralog/BlackboardObject#OrgActivity
</pre>

<pre>
  Policy OrgActivityAdd = [
     BlackboardTemplate
     A PlugIn in the role OrgActivityAdd can Add objects of type OrgActivity
  ]
</pre>

<H1>Servlet Access Tests</H1>

<H2>Testing the specification of the user domain </H2>

One of the features that we desired in the servlet policy mechanism
was the ablity to distinguish between the user george from the
RearUserDomain and the uuser george from the FwdUserDomain.  The test
that we use to make this distinction is  the 
AllowFwdPolicyServlet.delta policy.  This policy allows policy
administrators other than the RearUserDomain policy administrator to
access the policy servlet.
<p>
In order to enable this test, we need to move the rule
PolicyFwdUserAgent.rule to the society directory.
This creates a new
user administrator for the FwdUserDomain community.  
This rule is a bit
of a hack motivated by the desire to keep everything running on a
single host.  Ordinarily creating a second user community would
require setting up a new enclave that would have to live  on a new host.
<p>
The reason that
this rule  is not used by default is because it interferes with the
InitDM action.  The  InitDM action tries to login as george but  it
does not specify the user community.  Thus the InitDM action can fail
because it attempts to login as FwdUserDomainComm\george which is
denied.  This is not a serious problem - it means that we may need to
initialize the domain manager by hand with  the commands:
<pre>
  cd $CIP/configs/security
  policyUtil commit --dm --auth RearUserDomainComm\\george george localhost 8800 RearPolicyDomainManagerServlet OwlBootPolicyList
</pre>
<p>
Now we are ready to install the new policy.  Before installing the
policy, note how the system behaves before  the policy is
installed. Go to the web page:
<pre>
  http://localhost:8800/$RearPolicyDomainManagerServlet/policyAdmin
</pre>
and login as FwdUserDomainComm\george with a password of george.
When the web page comes up it will indicate that the access is
forbidden.  Then in the policies directory load the new policy
<pre>
  cd $CIP/configs/security
  policyUtil commit --dm --auth RearUserDomainComm\\george george localhost 8800 RearPolicyDomainManagerServlet AllowFwdPolicyServlet
</pre>
Go to the page again and the access will be granted.
<p>
This test shows that the servlet policy mechanism can distinguish
between users in different communities.
