/** 
 * <pre>
 *  The DetectTime class is used to indicate the date and time the
 *  event(s) producing an alert was detected by the analyzer.  In the
 *  case of more than one event, the time the first event was detected.
 *  (This may or may not be the same time as CreateTime; analyzers are
 *  not required to send alerts immediately upon detection).  It is
 *  represented in the XML DTD as follows:
 *
 *     <!ELEMENT DetectTime          (#PCDATA) >
 *     <!ATTLIST DetectTime
 *         ntpstamp            CDATA                   #REQUIRED
 *       >
 *
 *  The DATETIME format of the <DetectTime> element content is described
 *  in Section 3.4.6.
 *
 *  The DetectTime class has one attribute:
 *
 *  ntpstamp
 *     Required.  The NTP timestamp representing the same date and time
 *     as the element content.  The NTPSTAMP format of this attribute's
 *     value is described in Section 3.4.7.
 *
 *  If the date and time represented by the element content and the NTP
 *  timestamp differ (should "never" happen), the value in the NTP
 *  timestamp MUST be used.
 * </pre>
