How to make the daml expander work (someday):

1. Make sure that the line 
	org.cougaar.config.path=...
   in the $CIP/configs/security/Linux.props file includes 
      /mnt/shared/integ/configs/daml

2. Make sure that everything in the directory 
	UL/securityservices/test/configs/daml
   is in the directory 
	${CIP}/configs/daml

3. In the $CIP/configs/daml directory, run the command

      SecureNode EnclaveOnePolicyManagerNode


4. After the EnclaveOnePolicyManagerNode, run kpat in the
   ${CIP}/configs/daml directory.

5. When kpat brings up the "select authenticate scheme" popup, click on cancel.

6. Click on the Namespaces tab
	 + Click on Load Namespace...
	 + Click on http://ontology.coginst.uwf.edu/Ultralog/UltralogOntologies.daml
	 + Click on Load Selected Namespaces
   KPAT will go away for a while while it is loading things.

7. If you then click on the Actor Classes tab, you should see 

      http://ontology.coginst.uwf.edu/Ultralog/Names/ActorClasses.daml#AdminAssistant

   at the top of the list.  It may take a refresh to get here.

8. To load a (nonconditional) policy, first choose a subject for the
   policy (under the actor classes tab).  Then click on load under
   policy description.  To manually load the policies for the UseCases
   at a given threatcon, load all the policies with the
   UseCaseXThreatConY name.  For use case 1 and 3, Role 1 =
   CAAdministrator and Role 2 = AdminAssistant.  For use case 2, the
   only subject is the AG1 members.  We will see if I succeed in
   loading non-conditional policies which would save you this pain.






---->>Types of Files and Configuration Notes

1. In my directory ${CIP}/configs/daml, I have three .ini files:
      EnclaveOnePolicyManager.ini   EnclaveOnePolicyManagerNode.ini
      EnclaveOnePolicyManagerServlet.ini

   The one thing that I know about them is that the
   EnclaveOnePolicyManager.ini file has two lines that start the expanders:

   plugin =org.cougaar.core.security.policy.daml.DamlExpander
					(policy-highlevel.init,1,false)
    plugin =org.cougaar.core.security.policy.daml.DamlExpander
					(policy-lowlevel.init,2,true)

   The job of these expanders is to translate the policy one level.
   The integer (1 or 2 or...) says where the expander is in the
   sequence.  The true and false indicate whether the expander is
   first in the series. I run the node with the command

	 SecureNode EnclaveOnePolicyManagerNode.ini

2. The policy*.init files guide the canned expansion.  Each line
   consists of the name of a daml file followed by a list of files
   that the daml file should be expanded to.  This file is re-read
   every time that a new policy is seen by the expanders.  This means
   that the file can be dynamically modified if things go wrong.

3. The *.msg files are pre-built portions of the Use Case policies.
   Loading them into KPAT will give the use cases.

4. The *.cpmsg files are the pre-built Use Case policies expressed as
   conditional policies.

5. The *.daml files are daml files representing daml policies that we
   recognize and daml policies that the expander puts out.

6. The *.xml files are the policies that live at the very end of the
   expansion process.  These files go to the enforcers.

7. In the directory 
	  securityservices/src/org/cougaar/core/security/policy/daml
   I have three java files
	 DamlExpander.java 
	       This does the actual expansion.
	 DamlPolicyExpansion.java
	       This is an object that is published to the blackboard.
	       It ensures that the other policy expanders will not
	       pick up daml expansion updates.
	 SerializableDAML.java
	       This is a version of the DAMLModel that is serializable.
	 Forgetful.java
	       This massages the daml files that we get so that we can
	       read them and also test them for equality.

---------------------------------- STATUS ----------------------------------

Summary: The code works except that when it is run on the bigger
society in the lab we get an infinite expansion loop.  It is not clear
how this is possible and it will take some figuring out.

-1. The use cases have trouble.  Some of this might be KPAT but some
    of the Use case need to be redone.  Also I need to put the
    expansions in policy-highlevel.init and policy-lowlevel.init.
    The only expansion that work is the test.msg example in the
    examples that follow.

0. We get an infinte expansion loop when it is run on the society in
   the lab.

1. The Locator is not tested yet.

2. There seems to be an update message with UpdateType set
   incorrectly.  The bug can be seen from the comment "leading to a
   mismanagement of the daml policy set".  To get this bug, in KPAT
   make a policy with AG1Member as the subject and test.msg as the
   policy.  It will happen during the commit.  There are several
   things that I can try   to fix before I chase this.  This doesn't
   look like my problem (?).
