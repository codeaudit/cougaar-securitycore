Install tethereal
=================
Install tethereal 0.9.12 (which is not part of the RedHat distribution).
Because of package dependency issues on RedHat, it is easier to download the source code,
compile and install it.

Download ethereal-0.9.12.tar.gz

tar xvfz ethereal-0.9.12.tar.gz
cd ethereal-0.9.12
./configure
make
make install
