   * Protects a data stream by signing and/or encrypting the stream.

   *  encrypted and/or signed data should be persisted.

   *  This service will return an OutputStream that the client should
   *  use to write the unprotected data. The encrypted key that must
   *  be used to decrypt the stream will be placed in the key
   *  envelope. The client is responsible for retaining the encrypted
   *  key and providing it when the stream is subsequently decrypted.
   *  The encrypted key is usually a symmetric key encrypted with the
   *  public key of the agent.
   *
   *  This service must be able to re-encrypt symmetric keys at any time.
   *  For instance, keys may be re-encrypted if the certificate containing
   *  the public key is about to expire, or if the certificate is revoked.
   *
   *  In order to get access to keys at any time, the client must
   *  implement the PersistenceProtectionServiceClient interface,
   *  which provides an iterator over all the key envelopes into which
   *  keys have been placed. The client is responsible for storing the
   *  envelope, so that it is available in the Iterator.
