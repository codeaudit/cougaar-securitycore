# Declarations Section
#

#
# Each of the declarations that follow defines names of policy
# concepts.  These names are used for stating and reasoning about
# policy.  However, in order for these names to be understood by the
# Ultralog enforcers, we need a mapping file that tells how Ultralog
# names are translated into policy names.  
#
# The two exceptions to this scheme are 
#  1. message verbs which are declared in Ontology-EntityInstances.owl and 
#     don't need a mapping file, and
#  2. communities which are declared in Ontology-GroupInstances.owl
#     and don't need a mapping file.
# I haven't moved the verb declarations because it requires a hack
# which I am not yet happy with.  I haven't moved the community
# declarations because they may be going away and I am concerned that
# there might be a performance hit.
#

#
# The policy prefix is prepended to each of the policy names.  It can
# be used - if desired - to arrange that built policies reside in a
# subdirectory.
#
PolicyPrefix=%OwlBootPolicy


#
# The mapping file for the following KAoS policy names is OwlMapUserRole.

# Message Passing Policies
#
#     Note: Users of the message passing policy templates need not worry
#           about the policy assumptions because the policy templates
#           satisfy the assumptions. 
#
# Policy Assumptions:
#     1. Positive policies have priority two and can only involve the
#        sender and the receiver and the verb
#     2. Negative policies have priority three and do not involve the verb.
#
#
# Justification:
#    The message enforcer has two enforcement phases and both phases
#     make decisions based on incomplete information.  In order for
#     these enforcers to make valid decisions assumptions 1 & 2 are
#     necessary.

#
# Servlet Policies
#
#     Note: Users of the servlet policy templates need not worry
#           about the policy assumptions because the servlet policy
#           templates satisfy the assumptions.
#
# Policy Assumptions:
#
#     1. Positive policies have priority two and can only involve the
#        set of users accessing the servlet and the name of the
#        servlet being accessed.
#     2. Negative policies have priority three.
#     3. Negative policies involving the authentication scheme
#        cannot involve the users.  One can only have negative
#        policies involving the user and a particular servlet in the
#        case that the policies require authentication scheme for
#        that servlet that actually identifies a user (e.g. not 
#        NoAuth or NoAuthSSL).
#     4. Policies only require Audit.  E.g. positive polices do not
#        involve audit and no policy states that audit is illegal.
#
# Justification:
#    The Servlet enforcer has two enforcement phases and the first
#     phase uses incomplete information. In order for the first phase to make
#     valid decisions assumptions 1 & 2 are necessary.  Assumption
#     three is a detail based on how mediation is performed.  A less
#     efficient mechanism would not need this assumption.
