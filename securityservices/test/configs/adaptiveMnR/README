Adaptivity M&R:
---------------

In order to use the adaptivity engine, the following plugins will need to be loaded:

org.cougaar.core.adaptivity.AdaptivityEngine
org.cougaar.core.adaptivity.ConditionServiceProvider
org.cougaar.core.adaptivity.OperatingModeServiceProvider
org.cougaar.core.adaptivity.PlaybookManager(<plays file>)

If your plays contain operating modes that can be remotely constrained, you must include the
plugin on the remote agent:

org.cougaar.core.adaptivity.OperatingModePolicyManager

An optional servlet is available to view adaptivity objects (conditions and operating
modes) and edit operating mode policies.  Include the following plugin in your agent ini file:
org.cougaar.core.servlet.BlackboardServletComponent(org.cougaar.core.adaptivity.AEViewerServlet, /aeviewer)

AMnRPlays.txt specifies the plays for the Adaptive M&R agent.  To set remote operating modes,
use [agent.<agent name>] preceeding the operating mode name.  For example, 
[agent.MyAgent]org.cougaar.core.security.monitoring.MY_OPERATING_MODE = 1.  This will causes an 
InterAgentOperationModePolicy to be created and sent to MyAgent agent. The 
OperatingModePolicyManager in MyAgent will apply the constraint, 1, to MY_OPERATING_MODE. If all
components reside in the same agent, then [agent.<agent name>] should not preceed the operating 
mode name.  NOTE: "agent" in the brackets IS CASE SENSATIVE.

To run the test AdaptiveMnR agent type 'Node AdaptiveNode'.  Access 
http://localhost:8800/$AdaptiveMnR/aeviewer to view the conditions and operating modes.  Refresh
the browser every 10 secs and the conditions should change.  When plays are selected the operating
modes should also change.

The plays are written to with the following assumptions:
1. The Agent name of the Policy Manager is "DomainManager".  If it is different, change the plays to
reflect the Policy Manager agent name.
