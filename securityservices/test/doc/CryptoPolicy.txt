This file contains instructions for changing crypto policies. An example of an XML based policy file is located in $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/configs/common/BootPolicy.ldm.xml. This file is served as a set of default policies upon boot time, after booting, policies can be dynamicly updated via the KPAT tool.

IncomingSecureMethod
====================
	The expected method of securing on incoming messages.
	* Possible values	: plain, encrypt, sign, or signAndEncrypt
	* plain	: no method of securing is applied.
	* encrypt	: messages are encrypted with a symmetric key, which is encrypted using the receiver's public key.
	* sign	: messages are signed using sender's private key.
	* signAndEncrypt: messages are signed with the sender's private key and encrypted with a symetric key sealed with the receiver's public key.

OutgoingSecureMethod
====================
	Same as "IncomingSecureMethod" except this one is applied to sending out messages.

IncomingSymmetricAlgorithm
==========================
	The expected algorithm applied to "encrypt" or "signAndEncrypt" on the incoming message. If "plain" or "sign" is used, this parameter is ignored.
	* possible values: DES, or DESede

OutgoingSymmetricAlgorithm
==========================
	Same as "IncomingSymmetricAlgorithm" except this one is applied to sending out messages.


IncomingAsymmetricAlgorithm
===========================
	The expected algorithm applied to "encrypt" or "signAndEncrypt" on the incoming message. If "plain" or "sign" is used, this parameter is ignored.
	* possible values: RSA/ECB/PKCS#1, or ElGamal/ECB/PKCS#1

OutgoingAsymmetricAlgorithm
===========================
	Same as "IncomingAsymmetricAlgorithm" except this one is applied to sending out messages.

IncomingSigningAlgorithm
========================
	The expected algorithm applied to "sign" or "signAndEncrypt" on the incoming message. If "plain" or "encrypt" is used, this parameter is ignored.
	* possible values: MD2withRSA, MD5withRSA, or SHA1withRSA 

OutgoingSigningAlgorithm
========================
	Same as "IncomingSigningAlgorithm" except this one is applied to sending out messages.
