// Society level play book

/* This playbook is used to evaluate the perceived threat level of a society and take actions
 * when the threat level changes. The perceived threat level depends on how many login failures
 * occur in a period of time.
 *
 * Every T1 seconds, the loging failure analyzer evaluates the number of login failures over the
 * past T2 seconds. The analyzer aggregates all the login failures from all users.
 * The current login failure analyzer recipe is setup with T1=20 seconds and T2=20 minutes.
 *
 * When the rate of login failures crosses a threshold, the perceived threat level changes and
 * the preventive measure policy may change. The login failure analyzer always returns the login
 * failure rate in number of failures per day, regardless of the settings of T1 and T2.
 * Currently, this playbook file defines three perceived threat levels (1, 2 and 3).
 *
 * In every threat level, each user is allowed R login attempts before that user is locked out
 * for L seconds. For example, in threat level 1, user mbarger is allowed 10 login failures before
 * the mbarger account is locked out for 60 seconds. After 60 seconds, the mbarger user can try
 * to login again.
 * If the lockout duration is set to -1 (as in threat level 3), then the user is locked out
 * until an administrator unlocks the account.
 *
 * In threat level 1 and 2, the preventive measure policy is set to LOW. This mode allows users
 * to login using either a password or a certificate.
 * In threat level 3, the preventive measure policy is set to HIGH. Users must provide a certificate
 * to login.
 *
 * 1080 login failures/day == 15 failures/20 minutes
 * 2160 login failures/day == 30 failures/20 minutes
