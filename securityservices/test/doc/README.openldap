LDAP-HOWTO
----------

1. Install the openldap.org LDAP server. You may also want to download the 
   GQ LDAP browser which is a Gnome application. This tool is handy for viewing
   the credentials stored in the server. See the following for more info.

http://www.openldap.org
http://biot.com/gq
   
2. Edit the slapd.conf which was installed into /etc/openldap:
   LDAP server use schema to define the information they can contain. In order
   for the server function properly at least two schema need to be included:

include		/etc/openldap/schema/core.schema
include		/etc/openldap/schema/java.schema

   The second schema file allows us to store java objects directly into the 
   LDAP server. This is very convenient since Ultra*Log is implemented using
   Java. Next, go to the database section of the slapd.conf file, you should
   add something similar to the following:

suffix		"dc=cougaar,dc=org"
rootdn		"cn=manager,dc=cougaar,dc=org"
rootpw		foo

   The suffix field is automatically appended to any queries performed by the 
   server. The root distinguished name (rootdn) is the name of the superuser 
   who is expempted from access control rules. This should only be used by the
   certificate authority. The root password (rootpw) is the password field for
   the rootdn account. It i salso helpful to add the following directives:

index	objectClass	eq
index	cn		eq

   These specify fields for which the server needs to maintain indexes. 

3. Now that the daemon has a basic configuration. It still has an empty 
   directory context. Each CA can be given a separate directory context. 
   Each context including the rootdn needs to be added to the server. First,
   start the openldap daemon, using either the /etc/rc.d/init.d/ldap script
   or by running the daemon directly as root (since the default port number is 
   below 1024).

su root
/usr/libexec/slapd

   OpenLDAP comes with a few command line tools 
  





The LDAP servers are configured using an URI such as ldap://pear:389/dc=cougaar,dc=org which mean the server is 

NOTE: URL's should look like the following without any trailing slashes:

		   ldap://pear:389/dc=cougaar,dc=org 
		   ldap://pear:389/dc=nai,dc=cougaar,dc=org 

Before running the examples below make sure your $CLASSPATH is set include the ${COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH}/sys/securityservice.jar (and all other lib and 3rd party jar files).

Listing the contexts of a directory:

java com.nai.security.certauthority.LDAPCert list "ldap://pear:389/dc=cougaar,dc=org"

Removing a certificate from the directory:

java com.nai.security.certauthority.LDAPCert remove "ldap://pear:389/dc=cougaar,dc=org" cn=69fe38e2af8910d646d43e1666901133

Adding certificates to the directory:

java com.nai.security.certauthority.LDAPCert put "ldap://pear:389/dc=cougaar,dc=org" ~/tools/certificates/CaSignedCertificates/SignedReq-ROOT-CA-CONUS-TEST-NODE-NCA.cer ~/tools/certificates/CaCertificates/ROOT-CA-CONUS.cer

java com.nai.security.certauthority.LDAPCert put "ldap://pear:389/dc=cougaar,dc=org" ~/tools/certificates/CaCertificates/ROOT-CA-CONUS.cer ~/tools/certificates/CaCertificates/ROOT-CA-CONUS.cer
