Install tethereal
=================
Install tethereal 0.9.12 (which is not part of the RedHat distribution).

There are two methods:
1) Download the source code, compile and install it.
2) Install RPM packages.
Because of package dependency issues on RedHat, it is not necessarily easier to 
install the RPM package.

1) Download source code
   ====================
Download ethereal-0.9.12.tar.gz

tar xvfz ethereal-0.9.12.tar.gz
cd ethereal-0.9.12
./configure
make
make install

2) Install RPM package
   ===================

Package dependency issues depend on what packages are installed on your system.
On a system where a lot of packages are installed, you may have to do the following:

First, remove the following packages:
rpm -e net-snmp net-snmp-utils ethereal ethereal-gnome net-snmp-devel \
     kernel-utils php-snmp  kernel-uml libpcap

Then install the following packages:
rpm -i ethereal-common-0.9.12-2.i386.rpm tethereal-0.9.12-2.i386.rpm  \
	openssl-0.9.6j-1.i386.rpm ucd-snmp-libs-4.2.6-2.i386.rpm libpcap-0.7.1-3.i386.rpm
