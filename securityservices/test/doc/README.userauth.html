<B><P>Introduction</P><DIR>

</B><P>User authentication from NAI supports client side certificate authentication and HTTP password authentication. It provides SSL communication with remote server, and it provides SSL client authentication by unlocking user certificate from keystore. It also enable HTTP(S) password authentication for a user application.</P>
<P>If agents were configured to require user authentication, HTTP will be disabled and HTTPS will be enabled. In addition, Tomcat will require user to provide appropriate credentials. For instance, a user will have to provide a login ID/password, a certificate, or a smart card. Standalone applications communicating with servlets will have to support HTTPS and credential handlers. Standalone applications will NOT work if they are not modified to support user authentication.</P></DIR>

<B><P>1. User authentication mechanism in detail</P><DIR>

</B><P>We identify two basic authentication schemes, certificate authentication and password authentication. They are registered to a service org.cougaar.core.security.userauth.UserAuthenticator.</P>
<P>The service will prompt user for username/userid or password, for each authentication scheme, either at application startup or when needed.</P>
<P>Http password authentication will not occur until connection to a website is attended, the website will send authentication request and decide whether the password is correct).</P>
<P>Certificate authentication can be done at startup/login time because the password to unlock certificate can be verified locally against local keystore.</P>
<P>User application can add in its own authentication scheme by registering the authentication scheme to UserAuthenticator. For example, user can develop alternative UI to replace default BasicAuthHandler and have the password authentication (UserPasswordAuthentication) goes through the custom authentication </P>
<P>handler by setting it to be the listener. Another example is when smart card authenticator is available, it will be registered as a new authentication scheme, and the user SSL service will be listening to the smart card authenticator for user certificate.</P>
<P>HTTPS support is transparent to user application, there is no programming needed to support HTTPS. The user application should allow user the flexibility of specifying the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and port. </P>
<P>When the code uses any HttpURLConnection based classes to connect to a remote host through HTTP (URL, URLConnection, etc), it will uses the SSLServerSocketFactory from HttpURLConnection to handle HTTPS connection. </P>
<P>User authentication sets HttpURLConnection to use its custom socket factory and handles all the https connection for the user application.</P>
<P>HTTP password authentication is similar, user authentication will set itself as the authenticator for password authentication, and all password authentication in JDK that uses Authenticator class will use user authentication as the authentication provider.</P></DIR>

<B><P>2. Code changes needed.</P><DIR>

</B><P>The following code must be called once at application startup. </P>
<P>This code initializes the security library.</P>
<P>Class cls = Class.forName("org.cougaar.core.security.userauth.UserAuthenticatorImpl");</P>
<P>cls.newInstance();</P>
<P>We currently support one user per application instance. Each user must launch one instance of the application.</P></DIR>

<B><P>3. Environment setting changes needed.</P><DIR>

</B><P>The file userauth.script includes library paths and environment parameters needed to run user authentication. The settings in the file need to be integrated to the user application's settings.</P>
<P>The file userauth.tar includes the directory structure for the class files and config files. The file needs to be extracted and the path $APP_INSTALL_PATH should point to the extracted path (cougaar).</P>
<P>If cougaar is installed, the $APP_INSTALL_PATH can point to $COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH.</P></DIR>

<B><P>4. Configuration needed to run user authentication.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>cryptoPolicy.xml - this file is located in /cougaar/configs/common in userauth.tar. This file is used to configure keystore and truststore.</P><DIR>

<P>keystoreFileName - local keystore filename, this file will be located at /cougaar/workspace/security/keystores/$node/. It will be created automatically if it does not exist when user authentication is started.</P>
<P>keystorePassword - local keystore password, this parameter should be changed to a confidential password.</P>
<P>CA_keystore - truststore filename. This file should locate at the same directory as where the userauth.script starting script is run.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;      CA_keystorePassword - truststore password, this parameter should</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;be changed to a confidential password.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>trustedCA - these parameters specifies which CA (alias and common name) to trust, where to get certificates issued by this CA (LDAP). These parameters need to be set to your CA's specifications.</P></DIR>

<P>Truststore configuration - if SSL/HTTPS is to be used, server authentication is required. The CA that issues certificate to tomcat servers needs to have its certificate present in the truststore. </P>
<P>Therefore, either the tomcat servers' certificates or the CA certificate needs to be imported to the truststore whose filename is specified in CA_keystore above.</P>
<P>Keystore configuration - servlet application will require user authentication for access privileges. </P>
<P>Therefore user key pair needs to be generated and stored in the user keystore which is specified above as keystoreFilename. User certificate request should be generated and sent to CA to obtain a user certificate.</P>
<P>The user certificate then should be imported into user keystore.</P>
<P>Trusted CA configuration – to request user certificate automatically from a CA (see section 7), trusted CA needs to be set. The configuration includes a URL to send certificate request (the URL may use HTTP or HTTPS depending on CA’s configuration), CA domain name, CA LDAP URL (to check whether a certificate has been revoked), and LDAP server type. </P></DIR>
</DIR>

<B><P>5. Configuration needed for HTTPS and password authentication</P><DIR>

</B><P>HTTPS - HTTPS needs to be enable from the server side. If the server is a Cougaar</P>
<P>&#9;node, it needs to be enabled by setting the following in the startup script</P>
<P>&#9;($CIP/bin/Node):</P>
<P>&#9;org.cougaar.lib.web.https.port={your Cougaar https port}</P>
<P>&#9;org.cougaar.lib.web.https.factory=org.cougaar.core.security.ssl.WebtomcatSSLServerFactory</P>
<P>&#9;For non-Cougaar, see server.xml for tomcat.</P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<P>&#9;On the user application side, change the original http and port to use https</P>
<P>&#9;and the https port.</P>
<P>Password authentication - The link below explains the detail:</P>
<P>&#9;http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-4.0-doc/realm-howto.html</P>
<P>&#9;Choose the BASIC authentication scheme for now. Digest will be available in the future.</P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<P>&#9;There is nothing to be done on the user side.</P>
<P>Note that password authentication does not require a CA.</P></DIR>

<B><P>6. Authentication process.</P>
</B><P>&#9;</P><DIR>

<P>When standalone application starts, an authentication method dialog will prompt user to choose the authentication scheme. If user chooses to use certificate, a dialog will prompt user for the certificate. If user chooses to use password, user will not be prompt for dialog until server requests authentication.</P>
<P>The certificate dialog has a list of all the certificate aliases in local keystore, user can select from the list or type in the alias in the alias field. User also needs to enter the password that protects the certificate private key. </P>
<P>Password authentication is cached for a particular site, so if there are multiple connections to the same site, once a password is authenticated there will be no more prompt for password. In the password dialog there is a check box to specify caching the password, this is to cache the password for use with other sites. If the box is checked and the password is authenticated, the password will be used for connection to new sites. If the password cached can not be authenticated for a new site, then the password prompt will reappear, for the sites that has already been authenticated this does not apply since their authentication are already done and will be reused.</P></DIR>

<B><P>7. Requesting user identity.</P><DIR>

</B><P>There are two ways to create user certificate. Appendix A includes step detail in how to manually create user certificate and get it signed by CA. The certificate dialog provides a UI (certificate request dialog) to automatically generate keys, request and install a user certificate from the CA specified in cryptoPolicy.xml.</P>
<P>The certificate request dialog prompts user for common name, organization unit, organization, location, state, and country. The credentials entered should uniquely identify the user. There is also a password section for user to enter password to protect the private key of the new certificate.</P>
<P>There could be multiple certificates for one user for different purposes, therefore, common name may not be just the user name. A user may choose an email address to use for an email application while other unique name for other application. A user may have multiple roles and thus access privileges, and the user should take consideration in setting up credentials.</P>
<P>The certificate request dialog will report the status of the request after the request is sent to CA. The status could be success if CA approves the request immediately, or pending if the request needs to be reviewed. If status is successful, the alias of the new certificate is added to the alias list of the certificate dialog and the certificate is ready for use. If status is pending, the request is resent when the standalone application is restarted, by the time CA may have approved the request or denied the request.</P></DIR>

<B><P>Appendix A. Step detail of the certificate configuration process.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>. use keytool to generate a certificate in &lt;keystore&gt;, &lt;keystore&gt; is located in the $APP_INSTALL_PATH/workspace/.../keystores/$node/keystore-user</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;keytool -keygen -alias &lt;userid&gt; -keystore &lt;keystore&gt; ...</P><DIR>

<P>The keystore password is set in APP_INSTALL_PATH/configs/common/cryptoPolicy.xml</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;(keystorePassword)</P>
<P>. use keytool to generate a certificate request</P>
<P>&#9;keytool -certreq -alias &lt;userid&gt; -keystore &lt;keystore&gt; -file &lt;userid&gt;.req ...</P>
<P>&#9;Set the keypass param to enter a password to protect the key. (the keypass</P>
<P>&#9;will be the password to enter in user certificate authentication prompt.)</P>
<P>. go to cougaar CA, copy and paste the content of &lt;userid&gt;.req into the</P>
<P>&#9;request field in the request page, choose pkcs10 and enter the correct</P>
<P>&#9;DN for the CA. The CA will display a page with the signed user certificate.</P>
<P>. copy the content of the user certificate to a file &lt;userid&gt;.crt</P>
<P>. import the certificate into &lt;keystore&gt;</P>
<P>&#9;keytool -import -alias &lt;userid&gt; -keystore &lt;keystore&gt; -file &lt;userid&gt;.crt ...</P>
<P>. import the CA certificate to the trusted store.</P>
<P>&#9;keytool -import -alias &lt;ca-alias&gt; -keystore &lt;truststore&gt; -file &lt;ca&gt;.crt ...</P>
<P>&#9;The ca-alias should be the same as specified as CA_alias in cryptoPolicy.xml.</P>
<P>&#9;The truststore is the CA_keystore as specified above.</P></DIR>
