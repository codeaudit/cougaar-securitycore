This society depends on the following overlays

	BBN commons
	BBN ulconfigs (for 2003 integration)
	SRI automation	
	ISAT plugins
	ISAT Acme (ASMT03)
	ISAT ConfigRules
	TICEnvironment OPlan overlay (w/o attacks)
        CSI securityservices
        CSI moptools

I am not sure that this is a minimal list.  With these overlays and
after setting up hosts.xml, this society should simply run.  When the
script (Policy.rb) completes the society is running and the domain
manager has been initialized with the boot policies.

The purpose of this society is to support testing of policies.  The
policies directory above has some policies that work with this
society.  The rules directory below is collecting a set of rules that
can be used with this society for some purpose.  These rules all have
disadvantages that mean that it does not make sense to always include
them.  For example, the BlackboardParam rule will allow some
additional blackboard access tests but will considerably slow down the
system.

More docuumentation can be found in the securityservices/test/doc
directory.
