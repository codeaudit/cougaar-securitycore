      <h1>User LDAP Database HOWTO</h1>
      Note that many of these steps are copied from the README.openldap.html
      file. You may use the same or different databases for user data
      and certificate data depending on your security needs.

      <ol>
        <li>
          Install the OpenLDAP server. You can get it from openldap.org
          or as a Redhat RPM:
          <pre>
http://www.openldap.org
http://www.rpmfind.net
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Copy the cougaar schema to the OpenLDAP schema directory:
          <pre>
cp securityservices/test/configs/common/cougaar.schema /etc/openldap/schema
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          3. If you are not using ldaps (LDAP over SSL), 
          you may skip this step.
          You must have a certificate and trust certificate list. First copy
          and edit the openssl.cnf:
          <pre>
cp /usr/share/ssl/openssl.cnf /tmp/slapdcert.cnf
vi /tmp/slapdcert.cnf
          </pre>
          Add the following lines into the
          <code>[ req_distinguished_name ]</code>
          section:
          <pre>
T                       = Certificate Title (Type)
T_default               = server
          </pre>
          Create a certificate request using openssl:
          <pre>
openssl req  -new -keyout slapdkey.pem -out slapdreq.pem  -days 3653 \
  -config /tmp/slapdcert.cnf -rand choose:five:random:files:here
          </pre>
          <p>
            You should choose 5 good random files.
            If you don't have enough, you
            may create some using /dev/urandom. See the urandom manual page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enter your certificate information. 
            For Common Name, use the complete
            host name where your ldap server is going to be run. Use your
            certificate authority to sign the certificate. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Put the slapdkey.pem, slapdcert.pem (signed certificate), and
            slapdca.pem (PEM export of the CA's public certificate) in a good
            certificate directory like
            <code>/usr/share/ssl/certs</code>. If the CA uses
            a jks keystore, export the public using:
          </p>
          <pre>
keytool -export -rfc -file slapdca.pem -keystore ./keystore-CONUS-RSA -alias conusca-1
          </pre>
          <p>
            Here's a little trick to make it so that your key doesn't require
            a password:
          </p>
          <pre>
openssl rsa -in slapdkey.pem -out slapd.key
          </pre>
          <p>
            Will ask you for your password and write
            out a key file without a password.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Edit the slapd.conf which was installed into /etc/openldap unless
          you have installed OpenLDAP other than the default location. You must
          be sure to include the cougaar user schema:
          <pre>
include         /etc/openldap/schema/core.schema
include         /etc/openldap/schema/cosine.schema
include         /etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema
include         /etc/openldap/schema/nis.schema
include         /etc/openldap/schema/cougaar.schema
          </pre>
          Modify the suffix, rootdn, and rootpw to work with your setup:
          <pre>
suffix		"dc=cougaar,dc=org"
rootdn		"cn=manager,dc=cougaar,dc=org"
rootpw		foo
          </pre>
          <p>
            The suffix field is automatically appended to
            any queries performed by the 
            server. The root distinguished name (rootdn) 
            is the name of the superuser 
            who is expempted from access control rules. 
            This should only be used by the
            user administration servlet and monitoring
            and response agents. The root
            password (rootpw) is the password field for
            the rootdn account. It is
            highly recommended that you encrypt the rootpw
            using slappasswd. 
          </p>
          <p>
            It i salso helpful to add the following directives:
          </p>
          <pre>
index   objectClass,uid,uidNumber,gidNumber,memberUid   eq
index   cn,mail,surname,givenname                       eq,subinitial
index   roleOccupant                                    eq
          </pre>
          <p>
            If you want to use SSL, add the following:
          </p>
          <pre>
TLSCertificateFile    /usr/share/ssl/certs/slapdcert.pem
TLSCertificateKeyFile /usr/share/ssl/certs/slapdkey.pem
TLSCACertificateFile  /usr/share/ssl/certs/slapdca.pem
# If you don't want the client to be forced to present a certificate,
# comment out the next line
TLSVerifyClient        1

# Force SSL strength to be 128-bit or better
security ssf=128
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the root entries to the LDAP server using slapadd. You will need
          to be root to do this:
          <pre>
slapadd -l userdb.ldif
          </pre>
          Where userdb.ldif is located in securityservices/test/data/full1AD.
          You may also create your own, with a minimum ldif file containing:
          <pre>
# Base for all user searches
dn: dc=cougaar, dc=org
objectClass: dcObject
objectClass: organization
dc: cougaar
o: UltraLog
description: User Database

# Define an entry to base role searches on
dn: dc=roles,dc=cougaar,dc=org
objectClass: dcObject
objectClass: organization
dc: roles
o: UltraLog
description: Role Database
          </pre>
          Note that the above are configurable, so you can change them to fit
          your needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start the LDAP server. For normal ldap:
          <pre>
/usr/libexec/slapd -h ldap:///
          </pre>
          Or for LDAPS:
          <pre>
/usr/libexec/slapd -h ldaps:///
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Modify the BootPolicy.ldm.xml to use your
          new user ldap server. If you
          have not included any users who belong to
          the UserManager in step 4,
          you should ensure that the useradmin servlet
          isn't blocked by the policy.
          If you have used the full1AD userdb.ldif 
          file, two users are granted
          that role: george/george and amarinea/amarinea.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the user administration servlet to your agent ini file:
          <pre>
plugin = org.cougaar.core.security.certauthority.CaServletComponent(org.cougaar.core.security.crypto.ldap.admin.UserAdminServlet, /useradmin)
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Start your Node using SecureNode and point
          it to your agent's user_admin
          servlet. You should be able to add roles,
          add users, and assign roles
          to those users. Once you have done so, you
          can assign policy to servlets
          using your domain manager (or modifying the
          BootPolicy.ldm.xml) to force
          users to login to particular agents or URLs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>WARNING: LDAPS FOR OPENLDAP DOES NOT SEEM TO BE WORKING WITH JAVA.</strong>
          I have gotten around this problem by using stunnel. Instead of using
          LDAPS in the slapd.conf file, use stunnel like this:
          <pre>
cd /usr/share/ssl/certs/
cat slapdcert.pem slapdkey.pem > slapd.pem
stunnel -p /usr/share/ssl/certs/slapd.pem -d 636 -r 389
          </pre>
          You should also add this to your <code>/etc/init.d/ldap</code>
          script so that it is
          automagically started.
        </li>
      </ol>
