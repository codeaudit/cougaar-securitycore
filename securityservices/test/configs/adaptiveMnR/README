Adaptivity M&R:
---------------

In order to use the adaptivity engine, the following plugins will need to be loaded:

org.cougaar.core.adaptivity.AdaptivityEngine
org.cougaar.core.adaptivity.ConditionServiceProvider
org.cougaar.core.adaptivity.OperatingModeServiceProvider
org.cougaar.core.adaptivity.PlaybookManager(<plays file>)

An optional servlet is available to view adaptivity objects (conditions and operating
modes) and edit operating mode policies.  Include the following plugin in your agent ini file:
org.cougaar.core.servlet.BlackboardServletComponent(org.cougaar.core.adaptivity.AEViewerServlet, /aeviewer)

AMnRPlays.txt specifies the plays for the Adaptive M&R agent.  To set remote operating modes,
use [Agent.<agent name>] preceeding the operating mode name.  For example, 
[Agent.MyAgent]org.cougaar.core.security.monitoring.MY_OPERATING_MODE = 1.  This will causes an 
InterAgentOperationModePolicy to be created and sent to MyAgent agent. The 
OperatingModePolicyManager in MyAgent will apply the constraint, 1, to MY_OPERATING_MODE. If all
components reside in the same agent, then [Agent.<agent name>] should not preceed the operating 
mode name.

To run the test AdaptiveMnR agent type 'Node AdaptiveNode'.  Access 
http://localhost:8800/$AdaptiveMnR/aeviewer to view the conditions and operating modes.  Refresh
the browser every 10 secs and the conditions should change.  When plays are selected the operating
modes should also change.
