In this document, we will describe a society that has been explicitly
designed for testing policy requirements.  The society is located in
<pre>
    securityservices/test/configs/policies/society/Policy.rb 
</pre>
and is configured in the same way as other csmart societies.  It has
the following features:
<ul>
<li> It can be run on a single node.
<li> It has special features for testing message passing policies,
     blackboard policies and servlet policies.
<li> There are a collection of command line tool policies that can
     used to test various policy features.
</ul>
We will illustrate these features by describing all the test policies
associated with this society and what they do.
<p>
Before doing any testing of the command line policies, one must
first run the policy script (Policy.rb) and wait for it to complete.
This script 
<ol>
<li> starts the society, 
<li> waits for critical Ultra*Log security components to come up
  (particularly the user manager which is  waiting for the community
  service to provide community information)
<li> commits an initial set of policies to the domain manager.
</ol>
Once the script is completed we are ready to continue with the policy
tests.

<H1>Blackboard Access Tests</H1>

We have configured the test society to make some blackboard access
tests very easy.  In RearWorkerNode there is an agent called
testBBPolicyAgent.  This agent has a servlet that adds OrgActivity
objects to the blackboard.  The boot policies and configutation files give
this agent the ability to add OrgActivity objects to the blackboard.
In particular the file OwlMapRoleUri has the line
<pre>
/$testBBPolicyAgent/OrgActivityAdd http://ontology.ihmc.us/Ultralog/PluginsInRole#OrgActivityAdd
</pre>

<pre>
   org.cougaar.glm.ldm.oplan.OrgActivity http://ontology.ihmc.us/Ultralog/BlackboardObject#OrgActivity
</pre>

<pre>
  Policy OrgActivityAdd = [
     BlackboardTemplate
     A PlugIn in the role OrgActivityAdd can Add objects of type OrgActivity
  ]
</pre>
